# Fixing the YJ - 11/1/20

I own a '94 **Jeep YJ** with an old **Black Diamond long arm lift**. One day, while off-roading, the **rear long arm** snapped clean on the trail. Given that we were miles from home, we had to come up with a makeshift solution. A few friends came out to help, and after some quick thinking, we ended up **ratchet-strapping** the broken long arm back up to its pivot point in the middle of the Jeep.

## Ratchet-Strap Engineering & Getting Home
What followed was nothing short of a MacGyver moment—we drove the Jeep back to my house on the freeway, with the long arm strapped in place by nothing more than **ratchet straps**. Despite the potential for disaster, it somehow held together all the way back.

## The Repair: Replacing the Long Arm
Once home, we realized we had some **extra long arms** lying around. After measuring and sizing the replacement, I got it welded to match the specs of the original long arm and reinstalled it on the Jeep. The installation process was straightforward, and after bolting everything back up, the Jeep was back on its wheels.

## The Aftermath & Future Outlook
The new long arm has held up well through some pretty tough wheeling sessions since the fix. Now, I'm just waiting to see when the **other long arm** will give out—but at least now I’m ready to replace it when it does.

This experience not only reinforced the importance of improvisation and resourcefulness on the trail but also provided some hands-on practice in welding and suspension work. It’s been a great learning opportunity in how to troubleshoot and repair critical off-road components when things go wrong.
