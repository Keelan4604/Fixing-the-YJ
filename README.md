# Fixing-the-YJ
11/1/20 We have a '94 YJ with an old black diamond long arm lift. Took it out one day and the rear long arm snapped on the trail. We had some friends come out and ended up rachet strapping the long arm back up to it's pivot in the middle of the jeep. And somehow managed to drive it back on the freeway all the way to my house on a homemade long arm out of ratchet straps. Turns out we had extra long arms, so I sized the extra, got it welded, and reinstalled it. Wasn't too hard and it still works after some pretty rough wheeling. Now just waiting for the other long arm to break.
